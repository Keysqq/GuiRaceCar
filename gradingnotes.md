## repo notes

- cannot create a branch for grading notes - not set as a collaborator on this repo
- had to create fork instead

- readme markdown file - renamed so that it would auto display - see pull request
- shows image

## project notes

- build the car from shapes, so that you can use a class to build the car. using a pic defeats the purpose
- good troubleshooting
